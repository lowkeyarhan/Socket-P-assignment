This is a sample text file for testing binary file transfer in our multi-threaded HTTP server.

The server should serve this file with Content-Type: application/octet-stream
and include a Content-Disposition header to trigger download.

Features being tested:
- Binary file reading
- Proper HTTP headers for file downloads
- Content-Length calculation
- File integrity preservation

This file should be downloaded when requested via GET /sample.txt

Test scenarios:
1. Single file download
2. Multiple concurrent downloads
3. Large file handling
4. Binary data integrity
5. Proper HTTP response headers

The server implementation should:
- Read files in binary mode
- Calculate correct Content-Length
- Set appropriate headers
- Handle file reading errors
- Maintain data integrity during transfer
