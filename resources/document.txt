This is another test file for binary transfer testing.

Multi-threaded HTTP Server Test File #2
======================================

This file is designed to test the server's ability to handle multiple file types
and ensure proper binary transfer functionality.

Key testing aspects:
- Concurrent file downloads
- Different file sizes
- Binary data preservation
- HTTP header accuracy
- Error handling

The server should maintain data integrity when serving this file as a binary download.
This includes proper handling of different character encodings and special characters.

Special characters test: áéíóú àèìòù âêîôû ñç ¡¿ €£¥ ©®™

Binary transfer requirements:
- Files must be read in binary mode
- Content-Length must be accurate
- No data corruption during transfer
- Proper MIME type handling
- Correct file download behavior

This file should trigger a download when accessed via HTTP GET request.
